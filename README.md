 [Click Me!](https://afternoon-harbor-85228.herokuapp.com/)
## Built With

- Ruby version 3.0.1
- RoR version 7.0.2
## Getting Started

The API will receive POST requests to create cars and reservations and GET requests to view cars and reservations.
The base URL is: https://afternoon-harbor-85228.herokuapp.com/

If you want to view cars you can call this endpoint:

/api/v1/cars

To do the same but with reservations call this endpoint:

/api/v1/reservations

Both endpoints will return a JSON response with the following format:

```
For cars:
{
  "id": 1,
  "price": 100,
  "brand": "Toyota",
  "model": "Corolla",
  "image": "image_url",
  "created_at": "2019-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
  "updated_at": "2019-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
  "description": "This is a car"
}

For reservations:
{
  "id": 1,
  "username": "John Doe",
  "car_id": 1,
  "created_at": "2019-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
  "updated_at": "2019-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
  "city": "Denver",
  "reservation_date": "2020-01-01 00:00:00",
  "to_date": "2020-01-01 00:00:00"
}
```

You can view a specific car by calling this endpoint:

/api/v1/cars/:id

Same goes for reservations:

/api/v1/reservations/:id

**If you need further information about the endpoints you can view the documentation navigating to `/api-docs`.
Or you can just click this [link](https://afternoon-harbor-85228.herokuapp.com/api-docs)**

If you prefer to clone the project locally, you can also get to the docs by navigating to http://`domain`:`port`/api-docs. Where `domain` is the domain of your server and `port` is the port of your server.
For example, if your server is running on port 3000, you can navigate to http://localhost:3000/api-docs.
There you will see a list of all endpoints and their descriptions.

**The project comes shipped with linters config for ruby, so ensure you have Rubocop installed in your local environment**

## Database creation

Run rails db:create db:migrate db:seed

Seeding deletes all cars and reservations then adds 2 cars and 1 Reservation.

P.S : if you are coming from a previous version, you might want to delete the database by running rails db:drop (run with caution as all data will be lost)
